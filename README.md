# Javascript Finesse trainer

## General

Place pieces one at a time where the grey shadow is.

You can change the pieces you want to train on, their positions and rotations by selecting or unselecting the colored letters and numbers in the Piece settings section. You must then validate your settings by clicking on the Apply changes button.

You can change your keybinds in the Keys settings menu, and your DAS/ARR preferences in the Piece settings.

Your total finesse errors, placed pieces, PPS are displayed, along with some tips to help you improve.

Expect your PPS to be slower than usual, as there is no way to foresee the next pieces placements.

## Mobile
